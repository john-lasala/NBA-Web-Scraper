# NBA-Web-Scraper

## About <a name = "about"></a>
This program is a web scraper that takes specific data from Basketball Reference using BeautifulSoup and organizes said data. It reads and displays data such as: league leaders, current standings, and past champions. The program utilizes the pandas dataframe and the text-table module to organize the information in a sorted and clean fashion. 

The motivation for this project stemmed from my interest in programming and basketball. I wanted to learn more about Python and decided to make something that can combine both of those things.
